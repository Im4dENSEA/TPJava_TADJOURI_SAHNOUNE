UDP Server/Client  
# UDP/TCP Chat App with Java sockets  
This lab project is a chat application developed in Java that uses sockets to enable communication between a client and a server. The lab covers setting up network communication using UDP and TCP protocols and managing multiple client connections through a multithreaded TCP server.
## Prerequisites ##
* A Java development Kit (JDK)
* A Java development environment (here we used Visual Studio Code)
* A Machine running Windows, Linux ect (We worked on Windows)
## **1 â€“ Creating a UDP Client-Server**  

### Structure ###
* UDPServer.java: UDP server that listens for messages from clients and displays them along with the client's address.
* UDPClient.java: UDP client that reads user input and sends messages to the UDP server.
